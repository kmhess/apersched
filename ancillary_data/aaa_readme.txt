all_pointings.v7.18jun20.txt - Full sky survey grid calculated for the Apertif Timing and Imaging surveys (see Hess et al, in prep).  Only difference between this and previous versions was an update of survey labels.

all_sched.csv - All scheduled imaging observations of survey fields, copied from telescope parsets as they were sent to the telescope operators.  Includes ARGO pointings.

apertif_nov2021_CD.txt - Generated by make_new_pointing_file.ipynb and used at the end of the surveys instead of apertif_v12.21jan21.txt.

apertif_pointings_ncp.v4.png - NCP projection of a subset of Apertif imaging pointings. Shows the location of large-scale structure.

apertif_pointings_ncp.v5final.png - NCP projection of a subset of Apertif imaging pointings in apertif_v12.21jan21.txt (circles; label=s,m,l) and all the observed pointings in the final survey (all_sched.csv).  Generated by footprint_check.ipynb.

apertif_v12.21jan21.txt - Subset of the full sky survey grid (all_pointings.v7.18jun20.txt) for Apertif imaging survey.  This file is used in make_image_sched.py.  Number of visits to a field is controlled by the labels column.

arts_pointings_moll.v2.pdf - Molleweide projection of all the Apertif pointings in all_pointings.v7.18jun20.txt.

failed_obs.csv - Incomplete list of failed observations. Used for re-observing failed fields.

hetdex_vertices.fits - Used for plotting the HETDEX footprint.  Provided courtesy of Tim Shimwell.

imaging_map_210222.png - Sample output of make_imaging_sched.py which is displayed in README.md.
